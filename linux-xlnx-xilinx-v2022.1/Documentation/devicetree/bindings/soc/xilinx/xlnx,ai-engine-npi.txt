Xilinx AI Engine NPI
--------------------

The Xilinx AI Engine NPI space is where the privileged operations for AI Engine
device are handled, such as reset and pll. The space is typically meant to be
owned by platform management software, and this space is accessible only when
the platform management software grants the access. Thus, this dt binding only
works in such configuration, and in case the platform locks the access,
the non-secure software fails to access the device.

This is a temporary solution to allow direct access to NPI space.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,ai-engine-npi"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

Example:

	aie-npi@f70a0000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,ai-engine-npi";
		reg = <0x0 0xf70a0000 0x0 0x1000>;
	};
