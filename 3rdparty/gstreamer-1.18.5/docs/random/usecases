Use cases for audio applications
--------------------------------

ANALYSIS
========

* find start and end  -x dB boundary

* find overall volume for complete track (peak/RMS/average)

* do level-triggered playback

CUE FILES
=========

Given a long audio file and a .cue file:
- an element should be able to read an audio input stream and a cue input
  stream and send new-media events based on the .cue file information
- a audiocdsink should be able to record this stream straight to disk

Use cases for core functionality
--------------------------------

THREADS
=======

* { sinesrc } ! { queue ! osssink }
  - play thread
  - pause input thread
  - output thread should keep playing as long as queue not empty
  - play input thread again
  - no gaps should be heard

Use cases for video applications
--------------------------------

THUMBNAILING
============
- load file
- figure out if it's playable
- ask length of file
- seek to middle
- snapshot one frame
- save to disk
