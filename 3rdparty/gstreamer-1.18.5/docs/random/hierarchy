OUTDATED
--------


Face it, the plugins/ directory hierarchy is crap. We want to propose a
better layout for it now. Some things to consider:

 - Elements have a klass member in the factory that is used to
   denote the functional type of the element. For example, the
   mp3 encoder has a klass of Codec/Encoder/Audio
   
 - The plugins can be grouped together by the media type they
   operate on or by the way they work (decoder/encoder)
   
In GStreamer all plugins are technically filters, the only way they
can be considered sources or sinks (input/output) elements is
by the absence of src/sink pads. At first sight the source/filter/
sink distinction is quite useless because most of the plugins
will go into the filters category anyway. 

We don't want to make the hierarchy too deep, yet provide a 
clean way to ask for a mp3 decoder element..

Anyway this is a rough proposal to fire off the discussions...
