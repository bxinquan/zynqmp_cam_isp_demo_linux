Presentation ideas for GUADEC 4 (thomasvs, April 8 2002)

* use gst-editor to create pipelines that make a karaoke machine
  in different steps and using different features

1) pipeline 1: play the free software song by Richard Stallman
2) pipeline 2: do the same but add a visualization plugin
3) create a small video using actual RMS footage
4) pipeline 3: play this video and the song together
5) Stallman is a bit hard to understand.  We want text.
   pipeline 4: use the subtitle reader to overlay text 
   maybe also do a bouncing ball overlay !
6) Stallman can't sing. Let's pitch-shift him.
   this will need MIDI or dynparams to control a pitch shifter
7) It sounds better, but still not quite there.  Replace him with a festival
   voice doing the pitch shifting.
