lat7a-14.psfu and lat7a-16.psf are two very poor
attempts at ISO 8859-13 (Latin-7) fonts:
lots of characters are incorrect.

lat7-14.psfu is much better, only it is rather ugly.
It throws in an euro at 0x80, and has G-breve, g-breve
at 0xcc, 0xec (instead of G/g with cedilla),
and has n-cedilla at 0xb7 (instead of middle dot),
and has apostrophe at 0xff (instead of quote).
