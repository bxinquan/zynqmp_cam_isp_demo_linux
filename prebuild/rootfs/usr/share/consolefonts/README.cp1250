cp1250.psfu is a font for Microsoft cp1250.
It was created by pasting suitable fragments of latin{0,1,2} fonts,
and the symbols occurring in neither (various quotation marks,
ellipsis, dagger, doubledagger, permille, bullet, endash, emdash,
trademark) were left out. Maybe someone who actually uses this font
can add them. - Andries
