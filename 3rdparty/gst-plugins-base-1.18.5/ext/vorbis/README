oggvorbisenc : encodes to vorbis inside an ogg stream. This is not the
               GStreamer way of doing things and should be removed for 
	       0.9. It is still called "vorbisenc" for backward compatibility
	       reasons. It also takes integer audio as input.
vorbisenc :    Encodes to a raw vorbis stream and should be used together
 	       with an ogg muxer such as "oggmux" it is called "rawvorbisenc".
	       It also takes raw float samples as input.

TODO for 0.9:

- remove oggvorbisenc.c and oggvorbisenc.h
- remove references to oggvorbisenc.[ch] in the Makefile and in vorbis.c
- remove the element vorbisenc.
- rename the element rawvorbisenc to vorbisenc.
