 LatGrkCyr - brief notes, primarily about which glyphs are available.

 These two fonts are intended to cover current European languages
written with latin, greek, and cyrillic alphabets.  Also esperanto.

 For a long time I've been happy with an 8x16 font, but now that I use
kms on a big screen I thought it best to have a bigger font (but I
still use the 1024x768 setting with an 8x16 font on that screen with
one machine).

  The 8x16 version will also be available in my sigma-consolefonts
package (a bdf font, some map files to identify which glyphs to use,
some perl, and a Makefile).  That package is targetted at people who
build from source and allows you to easily change the letter forms or
to add different glyphs if you need to.  Because of the limited size
of the character cell, it is sans-serif.  The font is public domain,
the other items are under BSD-style licenses.

 The 12x22 font is derived from iso01-12x22 and hence from the sun
12x22 font included in the linux kernel, therefore it is licensed
under the GPLv2.  This font has serifs, although for a few of the
added glyphs I've had to trim them.  As with the sigma font, the
letters have been resized to better allow for accents and diacritical
marks.

 My aim is to make the different glyphs reasonably easy to identify,
so I often ignore the "rules" about how to write them - in particular
see the acute, circumflex, and grave accents in the 12x22 font.

 Similarly, letters with descenders such as g, p, q have a raised base
so that the descender appears longer.

 I've also added a few obscure glyphs which are in the iso01 or latin1
fonts, just in case anyone still uses them.
