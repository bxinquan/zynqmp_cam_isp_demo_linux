Base Video Classes TODO

Main goal:

 Make the video encoder/decoder base classes more consistent with the
other GStreamer API, especially with the audio encoder/decoder base
classes.

API:

 The API should be named similar, the base classes should be used
similar by the sub-classes, the behaviour of the base classes should
be similar.
 Currently there are many, mostly small, differences between the audio
and video base classes API. Things like GstVideoState should be merged
with the stuff we have in 0.11 to make the API the same in 0.11 and
0.10 as far as possible, things like GstVideoInfo might make sense to
be backported (at least partially).


Specifics:
 * Use a GInstancePrivate for extensibility.

 * Try to move more common video objects to video.[ch]
