Requires: >= Qt 5.1 for the x11extras module (or else you need to
get x11extras from gitorious yourself)

This example illustrates how to integrate Gstreamer GL plugin with
Qt. In particular it uses glupload with fakesink elements to create
texture with decoded video frame. This texture is shared with
QGLWidget derived class, which paints a cube with video texture on
each face.

To compile the example, include and library paths might be adjusted in
.pro file according to your installation of the gstreamer and
corresponding development files. Most probably, the adjustments will
be necessary on Windows.

To run the example simply start executable file after compilation. If
there is no command line arguments provided, then videotestsrc element
will be used to generate video. The following pipeline will be created
in this case:

videotestsrc ! video/x-raw, width=640, height=480, framerate=(fraction)30/1 ! glupload ! fakesink sync=1

It is also possible to provide the video file name as a first command
line parameter, i.e. ./qglwtextureshare myvideo.ogv . In this case,
the following pipeline will be executed:

filesrc location=myvideo.ogv ! decodebin2 ! glupload ! fakesink sync=1

I would appreciate any feedback and improvement suggestions for this
example.

Have fun :-)
