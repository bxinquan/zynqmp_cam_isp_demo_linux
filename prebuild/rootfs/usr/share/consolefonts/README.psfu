The .psfu files have a built-in Unicode mapping,
the .psf files don't.

If you load a font (with setfont) without built-in
mapping, then you'll have to provide one separately
on the setfont command line.

Eventually we expect that all fonts will have built-in Unicode mappings,
and the .psfu files will be renamed .psf again.
