Xilinx DRM bridge
-----------------

The Xilinx DRM provides the interface layer called Xilinx bridge to bridge
multiple components with a series of functions. It models a simple
unidirectional communication, single client -> single bridge. The client
is not limited to DRM compatible drivers, but can be any subsystem driver,
but the client driver should call the bridge functions explicitly.

Provider
--------

The bridge provider should assign a corresponding of_node to struct xlnx_bridge.
For example, if its own node is used,

	provider_node: provider_node {
	};

	bridge.of_node = provider_device->of_node;

Client
------

The bridge client should have a phandle to the bridge device node. The bridge
device node should be passed to get a bridge instance,

       client_node {
	       xlnx,bridge = <&provider_node>;
       };
