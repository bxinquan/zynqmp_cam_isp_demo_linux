Some notes about various stylistic issues
-----------------------------------------

(This file should end up as a nice web page eventually)

CODING STYLE
------------
- No //-style comments allowed.  Never.  Reason: Forte doesn't support it.
- Our indentation style is codified in gstreamer/tools/gst-indent
- Don't mix tabs with spaces when writing new code.
- use GST_*_OBJECT as much as possible so it's clear which object you're
  logging for

SUBMITTING CODE
---------------
- new code submitted to core, plugins-base, or plugins-good needs to pass a
  review from another committer.
- submitting new base classes also means you look at targets for assimilation.
