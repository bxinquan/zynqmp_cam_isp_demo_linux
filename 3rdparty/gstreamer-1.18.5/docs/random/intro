GNOME Streamer is a pipeline-based media streaming framework.  It is built
on top of the gobject object model.

A pipeline consists of at one or more each of sources, sinks, and filters.
These elements may be combined inside container elements, which may have
their own specific properties, and act as any other element.  Each element 
has one or more pads, which are connection points.  These pads are
connected to chain from one element to the next, providing a path along
which buffers are passed.

Operation of the pipeline is fully automatic once a buffer is put in the
front of the pipeline.  As each element finishes its processing, it pushes
the buffer to the next element through an indirect function call, by way
of the two connected pads.
