Xilinx Video Test Pattern Generator (TPG)
-----------------------------------------

Required properties:

- compatible: Must contain at least one of

    "xlnx,v-tpg-5.0" (TPG version 5.0)
    "xlnx,v-tpg-7.0" (TPG version 7.0)
    "xlnx,v-tpg-8.0" (TPG version 8.0)

  TPG versions backward-compatible with previous versions should list all
  compatible versions in the newer to older order.

- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers set for the device.

- clocks: Reference to the video core clock.

- xlnx,video-format, xlnx,video-width: Video format and width, as defined in
  video.txt.

- port: Video port, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
  The TPG has a single output port numbered 0.

Optional properties:

- xlnx,ppc: Pixels per clock. Valid values are 1, 2, 4 or 8.

- xlnx,vtc: A phandle referencing the Video Timing Controller that generates
  video timings for the TPG test patterns.

- timing-gpios: Specifier for a GPIO that controls the timing mux at the TPG
  input. The GPIO active level corresponds to the selection of VTC-generated
  video timings.

- reset-gpios: Specifier for a GPIO that assert TPG (AP_RST_N) reset.
  This property is mandatory for TPG v7.0 and above.

- xlnx,max-height: Maximum number of lines.
  This property is mandatory for TPG v8.0. Value ranges from 64 to 7760.

- xlnx,max-width: Maximum number of pixels in a line.
  This property is mandatory for TPG v8.0. Value ranges from 64 to 10328.

The xlnx,vtc and timing-gpios properties are mandatory when the TPG is
synthesized with two ports and forbidden when synthesized with one port.

Example:

	tpg_0: tpg@40050000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,v-tpg-5.0";
		reg = <0x40050000 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&clkc 15>;

		xlnx,ppc = <2>;
		xlnx,vtc = <&vtc_3>;
		timing-gpios = <&ps7_gpio_0 55 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;

				xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_YUV_422>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				tpg_in: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&adv7611_out>;
				};
			};
			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;

				xlnx,video-format = <XVIP_VF_YUV_422>;
				xlnx,video-width = <8>;

				tpg1_out: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&switch_in0>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
