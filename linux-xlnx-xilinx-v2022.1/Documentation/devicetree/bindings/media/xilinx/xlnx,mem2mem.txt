Xilinx Video IP MEM2MEM Pipeline (XVIM2M)
----------------------------------------

Xilinx video IP mem2mem pipeline processes DMA transfers to achieve memory
copy from one physical memory to other. The data is copied by employing two
DMA transfers memory to device and device to memory transactions one after
the other. The DT node of the XVIM2M represents as a top level node of the
pipeline and defines mappings between DMAs.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "xlnx,mem2mem".

- dmas, dma-names: List of two DMA specifier and identifier strings (as
  defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt) per port.
  Identifier string of one DMA channel should be "tx" and other should be
  "rx".

Example:

	video_m2m {
		compatible = "xlnx,mem2mem";
		dmas = <&dma_1 0>, <&dma_2 0>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
	};
