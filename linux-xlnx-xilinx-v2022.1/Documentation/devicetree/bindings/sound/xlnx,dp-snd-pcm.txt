Device-Tree bindings for Xilinx ZynqMP DisplayPort PCM

The DPDMA driver of ZynqMP DisplayPort subsystem is based on DMA engine,
and the DP PCM driver is based on snd dmaengine helpers.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "xlnx,dp-snd-pcm" or "xlnx,dp-snd-pcm0" or "xlnx,dp-snd-pcm1".
 - dmas: the phandle list of DMA specifiers. The dma channel ID should be one
   of 4 for audio0 channel or 5 for audio1 channel.
 - dma-names: the indentifier strings for DMAs. The value should be "tx".

Example:

	xlnx_dp_snd_pcm0: dp_snd_pcm0 {
		compatible = "xlnx,dp-snd-pcm0";
		dmas = <&xlnx_dpdma 4>;
		dma-names = "tx";
	};
