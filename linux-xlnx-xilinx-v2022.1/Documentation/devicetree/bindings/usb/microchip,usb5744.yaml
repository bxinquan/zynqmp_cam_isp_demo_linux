title: Bindings for the Microchip USB5744 4-port Hub Controller

description:
  Microchip’s USB5744 SmartHub™ IC is a 4 port, SuperSpeed (SS)/Hi-Speed (HS),
  low power, low pin count configurable and fully compliant with the USB 3.1
  Gen 1 specification. The USB5744 also supports Full Speed (FS) and Low Speed
  (LS) USB signaling, offering complete coverage of all defined USB operating
  speeds. The new SuperSpeed hubs operate in parallel with the USB 2.0
  controller, so 5 Gbps SuperSpeed data transfers are not affected by slower
  USB 2.0 traffic.
