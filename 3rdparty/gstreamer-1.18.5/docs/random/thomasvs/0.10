general
-------
- write script to check for:
  invalid // comments
  invalid %lld
  invalid LL for 64bit ints
  wrong whitespacing
  trailing space

gstreamer
---------
- reorganize tests and examples into
  - testsuite
    - check: unit tests
    - examples: example code
    - interactive: interactive tests
- move gst/base to libs/gst/base ?
  (but elements link against them)
- move elements out of gst/ dir ?
- check/gst/pipelines: currently disabled, random failures

gst-plugins-good
----------------

- gst:
  - alpha, alphacolor: document with example

  gst-launch -v filesrc location=/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacspeak/sounds/default-8k/ask-short-question.au ! auparse ! osssink
    -> will move to bad
  - autodetect: OK
  - videofilter:
    - is the lib still needed, given basetransform ?
      yes
