# These dependencies are used to make certain that the module is fully
# loaded. Indeed udev starts this unit when it receives an uevent for the
# module but the kernel sends it too early, ie before the init() of the module
# is fully operational and /sys/fs/fuse/connections is created, see issue#17586.
