Description
-----------

Versal uses the Arteris FlexNoC interconnect instead of the ARM NIC. FlexNoC
provides the capability to integrate performance counters in the interconnect.
It has configurable probe points to monitor the packet and forwards it to
observer for logging. It supports read and write transaction counts for
request and response.

Features:
---> Run-time programmable selection of packet probe points.
---> Recording of traffic and link statistics.
---> Separate read and write response and request count.
